            <b>YOUR RIGHTS</b>
            <p>
                You are entitled to a range of rights regarding the protection of your personal information. Those
                rights are:<br>
                - The right to access the information we have about you. If you wish to access your personal information
                that we
                collect, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided below.<br>
                - The right to rectify inaccurate information about you. You can correct, update or request deletion of
                your personal
                information by contacting us using the contact details provided below.<br>
                - The right to object the processing. When we rely on your consent to process your personal information,
                you may
                withdraw consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided below. This will not
                affect the
                lawfulness of processing prior to the withdrawal of your consent.<br>
                - The right to lodge a complaint. You can raise questions or complaints to the national Data Protection
                Agency in your
                country of residence in the event where your rights may have been infringed. However, we recommend
                attempting to reach a
                peaceful resolution of the possible dispute by contacting us first.<br>
                - The right to erase any data concerning you. You may demand erasure of data without undue delay for
                legitimate reasons,
                e.g. where data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected, or where the data has been
                unlawfully
                processed.<br>
